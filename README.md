Titanic Data Preprocessing
This project is all about cleaning and preparing the Titanic dataset for machine learning.

What’s Done: 

Explored the dataset to understand structure and missing values

Filled missing values using mean for numerics and most frequent for categoricals

Encoded categorical features using label encoding

Scaled all features using MinMaxScaler

Visualized data distributions using boxplots

Removed outliers using the IQR method

Tools Used: 
Pandas & NumPy – for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for preprocessing (encoding, scaling, imputation)

The result is a cleaned, scaled dataset ready for building ML models.
